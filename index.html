        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Analise Angel but I mainly go by Annie. I am from San Diego, California but I am currently living in Riverside. I truly love San Diego because of its amazing weather, I havent been able to get the same one here in Riverside. I also love that all my family lives there as I am very close to my family. I also love that I am close to the border, as it truly provides me with the gift of being able to expirience the best of both worlds. Part of my family also lives in Mexico, which is why I love being so close. 
<br><br>

        When I was in high school, I didnt know where I wanted to further my education. I always wanted to go to a four year college, but I didnt have my mind set on any other details. For a while, I wanted to go far. I wanted to end up somewhere in the bay area such as San Francisco State or UC Santa Cruz. I also wanted to go out of state, being that the University of Arizona was one of my top choices. My mom has always been on top of it for everything I did, which was a major reason for why I wanted to go far. All of those schools previously mentioned were at least a six hour drive, which I thought was absolutely perfect for me. Looking back, I am so so so glad I didnt make that choice. One of the main reasons I am glad I ddint pick any of those schools is because I now have a much greater relationship with my mom and I go home almost every weekend. Being at Riverside, the drive is only an hour and a half. 
<br><br>

        I hope to grow a lot as a person while I am here. I want these next four years to be filled with new experiences, friendships, relationships, lessons, and success. I want to make all of my family proud and let them know that everything that they are doing for me to be here is worth it! So far over the past year, Ive had a lot of great moments that also came a few bad ones. I came in as an undeclared student and by the end of my first year, I was able to declare business! I also made a lot of amazing new friends who I am so thankful to have met, the college experience wouldve been far different without them. I also had a few humbling moments, one of them being that I got a D in my math class. Usually, the lowest grade I ever get is a B, so getting a D after trying was really hard on me. Math has always been the subject that I struggle with most, so I learned to be patient with myself. I have also learned what works for me and what doesnt work for me, as well as more about who I am as an individual. I hope that in the remaining years I continue to grow and push myself to do new things.
